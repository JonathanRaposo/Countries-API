# Countries-Api
Basic Api using JavasScrpt

Basic JavaScript Api that consists of searching a specific country. it shows the contry name, capital,location , population and flag. 
I made this API  to practice how to fetch data. I created a folder called countries which contains an array of countries. This is where the data comes from . I used just basick javascript code and the fetch api.
